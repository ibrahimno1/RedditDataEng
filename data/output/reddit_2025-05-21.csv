1kr4jcg,Early-career Data Engineer,"Right after graduating, I landed a role as a DBA/Data Engineer at a small but growing company. Until last year, they had been handling data through file shares until they had a consultancy company build them Synapse workspace with daily data refreshes. While I was initially just desperate to get my foot in the door, I’ve genuinely come to enjoy this role and the challenges that come with it. I am the only one working as a DE and while my manager is somewhat knowledgeable in IT space, I can't truly consider him as my DE mentor. That said, I was pretty much thrown into the deep end, and while I’ve learned a lot through trial and error, I do wish that I had started under a senior who could be a mentor for me.

Figuring out things myself has sort of a double edge, where on one hand, the process of figuring out has sometimes lead to new learning endeavours while sometimes I'm just left wondering: Is this really the optimal solution? 

So, I’m hoping to get some advice from this community:

# 1. Mentorship & Guidance

* How did you find a mentor (internally or externally)?
* Are there communities (Slack, Discord, forums) you’d recommend joining?
* Are there folks in the data space worth following (blogs, LinkedIn, GitHub, etc.)? I currenlty follow Zack wilson and a few others who can be found by surface level research into the space.

# 2. Conferences & Meetups

* Have any of you found value in attending data engineering or analytics conferences?
* Any recommendations for events that are beginner-friendly and actually useful for someone in a role like mine?

1kr1azg,How to build an API on top of a dbt model?,"I have quite a complex SQL query within DBT which I have been tasked to build an API 'on top of'.

More specifically, I want to create an API that allows users to send input data (e.g., JSON with column values), and under the hood, it runs my dbt model using that input and returns the transformed output as defined by the model.

For example, suppose I have a dbt model called `my_model` (in reality the model is a lot more complex):

    select 
        {{ macro_1(""col_1"") }} as out_col_1,
        {{ macro_2(""col_1"", ""col_2"") }} as out_col_2
    from 
        {{ ref('input_model_or_data') }}
    

Normally, `ref('input_model_or_data')` would resolve to another dbt model, but I’ve seen in dbt unit tests that you can inject synthetic data into that `ref()`, like this:

    - name: test_my_model
      model: my_model
      given:
        - input: ref('input_model_or_data')
          rows:
            - {col_1: 'val_1', col_2: 1}
      expect:
        rows:
          - {out_col_1: ""out_val_1"", out_col_2: ""out_val_2""}
    

This allows the test to override the input source. I’d like to do something similar via an API: the user sends input like `{col_1: 'val_1', col_2: 1}` to an endpoint, and the API returns the output of the dbt model (e.g., `{out_col_1: ""out_val_1"", out_col_2: ""out_val_2""}`), having used that input as the data behind `ref('input_model_or_data')`.

1kqyceq,Designing Robust Schema Registry Systems for On-Premise Data Infrastructure,"I'm building an entirely on-premise conversational AI agent that lets users query SQL, NoSQL (MongoDB), and vector (Qdrant) stores using natural language. We rely on an embedded schema registry to:

1. Drive natural language to query generation across heterogeneous stores
2. Enable multi-database joins in a single conversation
3. Handle schema evolution without downtime

* How do you version and enforce compatibility checks when your registry is hosted in-house (e.g., in SQLite) and needs to serve sub-100 ms lookups? For smaller databases, it's not a problem, but for multiple databases, each with millions of rows, how do you make this validation quick?
* What patterns keep adapters ""pluggable"" and synchronized as source schemas evolve (think Protobuf → JSON → Avro migrations)?
* How have you handled backward compatibility when deprecating fields while still supporting historical natural language sessions?

1krforx,How to define a validation framework for IoT and manual meter readings before analytics?,"Hello,

I'm not even sure if this post should be here but since my internship role is data engineering, i am asking because i'm sure a lot of experienced data engineers who have had problems like this will read this.

 At our utilities company, we manage gas and heating meters and face data quality challenges with both manual and IoT-based meter readings. Manual readings, entered on-site by technicians via a CMMS tool, and IoT-based automatic readings, collected by connected meters and sent directly to BigQuery via ingestion pipelines, currently lack validation. The IoT pipeline is particularly problematic, inserting large volumes of unverified data into our analytics database without checks for anomalies, inconsistencies, or hardware malfunctions. To address this, we aim to design a functional validation framework before selecting technical tools.

Key considerations include defining validation rules, handling invalid or suspect data and applying confidence scoring to readings, comparing IoT and manual readings to reconcile discrepancies. We seek functional ideas, best practices, and examples of validation frameworks, particularly for IoT, utilities, or time-series data, focusing on documentation approaches, validation strategies, and operational processes to guide our implementation.

Thanks to everyone who takes time to answer, we don't even know how to start setting up our data pipeline since we can't define anomaly standards yet and what actions to do in case of anomaly detection.

1krbroc,"I'm feeling lost in my DE journey, and extensive AI use has left me crippled","Hey everyone,

I'm 31M feeling incredibly lost and could really use some guidance from this community. I quit my receptionist job abroad at the beginning of 2024 to self-study Data Engineering, and it's been a rollercoaster ever since.

I enrolled in Dataquest's Data Engineering program and, somehow, managed to finish it recently. It took me a full year, with some gaps in between, but I kept pushing through. I've learned Python, SQL, PostgreSQL, CLI, GitHub, basic algorithms, NumPy, Pandas, and even pipeline concepts.

Here's the problem: **I don't feel confident enough to say I truly** ***know*** **any of it.** My main tool for learning and understanding code and concepts was AI. Now, I feel like I can't really code anything without it. Whenever I start a new portfolio project, I feel like I can't start or code without seeing a reference or using AI.

This extensive use of AI has gotten me to a level where **I can't start a script or project without a reference**. It's like my brain has become reliant on AI to fill in the gaps, and without it, I'm stuck. I'd open a new Python file and immediately feel this overwhelming urge to just type ""how to build a data pipeline in Python"" into AI. It's incredibly frustrating because I *want* to be able to build things independently, but I feel crippled without that crutch.

The thought of a technical inter view absolutely terrifies me. I can picture myself being asked to whiteboard a SQL query or code a simple Python function, and my mind just going blank. Even though I've ""learned"" these things, the active recall and problem-solving under pressure without AI assistance feels like an insurmountable hurdle. I worry that all my self-study has only given me a shallow understanding that won't hold up in a real-world scenario. 

# The Web Dev Detour & DE Doubt:

The weirdest part is, while feeling lost in DE, I stumbled into web development. I built two static websites, [**fixmypdf.in**](http://fixmypdf.in) **and** [**freeinvoiceonline.com**](http://freeinvoiceonline.com)  This was purely ""vibe coding"" by just messing around, learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as along the way. I actually felt a genuine sense of accomplishment and independence there since I self launched myself and really saw some people using it. It makes me question if Data Engineering is even the right path for me, or if I just got lucky with the web dev stuff. It's confusing to feel confident in one area I just ""vibed"" into, but completely lost in the field I've been diligently studying for a year.

# The ""Knowing"" vs. ""Doing"" Gap:

I am able to understand  data pipeline or an explanation of a complex SQL join, thinking, ""Yeah, I get that."" But when it comes to actually*doing* it, building it, or debugging it myself, it's a completely different story. There's this huge gap between intellectual understanding and practical application, and I feel like the AI has widened that gap. It's almost like I've been a passenger in my own learning journey, and now I need to learn how to drive.



I feel so lost right now. I don't know what to do next, 

**What should I do next?**

**How can I truly improve myself to break free from this AI dependency?**

**how to even begin looking for a job,** 

**how to truly improve myself to break free from this AI dependency.**

**Are the things I learned while building fixmypdf.in and freeinvoiceonline.com really a waste?**

**Did I really waste my past year of dedicated study? Do I still have hopes/chances to get into Data Engineering?**

Has anyone else experienced this over-reliance on AI during their learning journey? What steps did you take to overcome it? Any advice on how to bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical application, especially for someone trying to break into Data Engineering?

Any guidance, no matter how small, I would really appreciate it. Thanks in advance!",0,9,ramseywinster,2025-05-20 18:06:33,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1krbroc/im_feeling_lost_in_my_de_journey_and_extensive_ai/,0.36,False,False,False,False
1kqzwgx,"Opinion - ""grey box engineering"" is here, and we're ""outcome engineers""","Similar to Test driven development, I think we are already seeing something we can call ""outcome driven development"". Think apps like Replit, or perhaps even vibe dashboarding  - where the validation part is you looking at the outcome instead of at the code that was generated.

I recently had to do a migration and i did it that way. Our telemetry data that was feeding to the wrong GCP project. The old pipeline was running an old version of dlt (pre v.1) and the accidental move also upgraded dlt to current version which now typed things slightly differently. There were also missing columns, etc.

Long story short, i worked with Claude 3.7 max (lesser models are a waste of time) and Cursor to create a migration script and validate that it would work, without me actually looking at the python code written by llm - I just looked at the generated SQL and test outcomes (but i didn't look if the tests were indeed implemented correctly - just looked at where they failed)

I did the whole migration without reading any generated code (and i am not a YOLO crazy person - it was a calculated risk with a possible recovery pathway). let that sink in. Took 2h instead of 2-3d
